# 综合写作

## 阅读讲解

- 3 mins / 230 - 300 words
- 文章结构： 总观点 + 3分论点
- 观点类型：假说 / 优缺点 

（阅读和听力几乎是反驳的，没有听力支持阅读材料的）


### 阅读笔记

总原则：脱离材料，能记住三个分分论：**内容和顺序**

（听完听力，阅读材料还是会出现的，这个和口语是不一样的）

阅读记笔记可以帮忙**给听力列个提纲**


1. 总观点可以不记，读懂为主

2. 分论点，论点必须记，1-4 words。 细节可以省

3. 关键单词 、 专有名词 记一下，特别是意思和发音 （在听力当中会用到）


### 阅读信息提取

- 第一段中找到话题

- 第一段和最后一句：阅读总观点

- 二三四段第一/最后一段：阅读分论点

时间要分配一遍过，不要在回来翻看



## 听力讲解

- 2 mins 左右
- 和阅读是一一对应的反驳，一个总论点和三个分论点 （顺序也是吸纳沟通的）

尽量记所有的反驳内容（分论点和细节），不用记让步阅读是对的，或者表明阅读是对的


### 听力笔记技巧

1. 首句 / 首段

    一般的第一句是态度，可以不用记，给自己一个缓冲的时间

    但是紧接出现的观点，具体内容是需要记的

2. 路标词

    First / next / finally / as for / as to ... + 阅读分论点的总结

    如果没有记到就继续往下听，不要犹豫


3. 转折词

    如果在开头的话，可能是会让步于阅读，阅读的内容可以不用记。主要记后面的

    段内的对比需要记


4. 并列词

    子信息 / 并列论据；必须记


------------------

1. 中英拼音混合记
2. 适当画画，方位
3. 符号优先


## 写作讲解

- 20 min / 150 - 225 words 

- 结构： 1总 + 3分 （不用写结尾）

客观总结、听力作为主导、包含阅读内容 (阅读提供框架)

### 文章内容

- 开头段：

    （讨论话题）+ 阅读观点 + 听力的态度 （如果听力提出了一个新的观点，那么这里就写听力提出的观点）

- 正文段

    阅读的分论点是必须写的，其中，听力所反驳的阅读细节点需要写

    听力部分关注态度（就是不同意，有观点的写观点），细节有多细写多细


### 写作规则

1. 阅读一定要改写，换表述

    - 语态 （主动 VS 被动）
    - 同义词、表达替换
    - 句式的改写

    - 关键单词（分论点）不用改

2. 听力尽量写原文 （如果能记得住原文）


时态：阅读和听力的内容一般保持一般现在是第三人称单数的形式。具体的内容与原材料保持一致

Eg. she argues that (原文时态)
